# Contributing to ADkit 

Contributing to ADkit is simple. 

1. Clone the code from Github.  
2. Follow the README instructions to create your development environment. 
3. Implement your proposal on a new branch named as "feature/x", where x is your branch name.
4. Once ready, create a pull request and invite reviewers to take a look. 
5. Once everybody is happy and approves, you can merge your work into ADKit! 


## Tips to make your life easier.

Take a look at the style of existing code, e.g., variable typing, doctext, and try to use a similar style. 

We also would like the test coverage and code quality of ADKit to improve over time, so it pays to break down your code into small parts and then add tests for those parts in `/tests`.
